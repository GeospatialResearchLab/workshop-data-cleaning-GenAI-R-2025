## Abstract

This hands-on workshop introduces strategies for cleaning messy research data and shows how generative AI tools can support that process. You’ll learn how to identify common issues in tabular datasets including missing values, inconsistent formatting, and duplicates and how to plan a reproducible cleanup workflow. Then, we’ll explore how to use generative AI to help write R code for cleaning tasks, with an emphasis on producing reusable scripts and well-documented steps. Designed for graduate students working with real-world data, this session is useful for anyone preparing a dataset for analysis, visualization, or sharing. Prior experience with R is helpful, but not required.
